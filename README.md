# What is the concept of rock paper scissors?
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who chooses scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").

# What are the rules of rock paper scissors?
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Agree ahead of time whether you'll count off “rock, paper, scissors, shoot” or just “rock, paper, scissors.” Use rock, paper, scissors to settle minor decisions or simply play to pass the time.

# Rock, paper, scissors is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It's a great way to improve critical thinking and communication skills
